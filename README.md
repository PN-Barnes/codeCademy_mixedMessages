# codeCademy_mixedMessages
This is a project written in Javascript 

The project has a local repository and updated on GitHub

The script consists of three arrays with strings placed inside them. 
A random number generator to output a number.
the number outputted is then used to select a random message nested within the arrays.

The script will generate a random music genre.
Then, it will select a band within that genre.
Once a band is selected, a song from that band will be output as the song of the day.

Let me know what you think of my project and if there is anyway I can be more efficient with my coding. Thank you.
